## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries



### What I learned

Through this project I successfully learned to implement media queries and  also got the opportunity to actually view the real use case of CSS grids. It also help me refresh some topics like styling of list markups.


### Continued development

The proper scaling and alignments were a major problem to me and I should also focus on learning figma and designing parts.


### Useful resources
